       "[\"\\n\\n  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.\\n\\n\",\n",

I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?\\n\\n',\n",

THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Firstly, I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Update 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen.there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS.but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Pros:Design looks sleek and easy to handle though it's a big screen. Well balanced in the hand. My 3T feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference.Good Speed and performance.Very good display.Excellent cameras. Definitely a big change from previous models.Cons:Still in the process of experiencing the product. Will update based on my findings.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  No more function.When call from second sim first sim net disconnectedNot daily data usage option.Cheap phone. I really hurt after buy this company phone\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Phone is good but cover of the is given by OnePlus is damage. Let me know the procedure to replace .\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Nice phone...Camera superb, Battery great and ideal premium phone at such an affordable price\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Hands down. It's a beast. Flagship killer anyday.Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price.Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger.Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premiumStock android experience which I always love.Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now, iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent.I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn't look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don't need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing.Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go.Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.Hope this review is useful.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  From \"Darshita Electronics\", Today I received my New OP7T 8GB/128GB Glacier Blue model. But the device is Not Booting even after 1Hour and also doesn\\'t restart as well. Customer support person told me to Charge for 4 hours..! The device is already in Hot condition. I don\\'t know how it resolves the issue. Feeling cheated after spending a hard-earned money. Waiting for the replacement. Instead of buying from third party vendors, better Buy from OnePlus Site itself.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Battery life sucks!It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage.Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery.Think before you purchase.I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery. Otherwise everything else is fine with this phone. OnePlus needs to optimise the phone!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  \\xa0This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Product is worse, with respect to camera, it cannot reproduce the skin tone or texture even under broad day light. It struggles to sharpness and structure of image.My earlier review was removed for being honest, let's see, the Amazon is really considering to hide the fact by not accepting the real customer problem and removing it\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  The said phone is a piece of beauty. Looks amazingly beautiful in hand and the in-hand feeling is just awesome.From the very beginning the buying process on Amazon is simply smooth thereafter the product was delivered before the expected delivery time.The phone looks really sophisticated and the 90 Hz Display is smooth like never before. The Glacier Blue colour is the one which is being promoted predominantly by OnePlus but trust me the Frosted Silver colour is stunning.These are just the initial impressions and a more detailed review will follow after a few days of intense usage.\\n\\n']"

       "'\\n\\n  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don\\'t go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don\\'t fall for it.5. Sound: It\\'s average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller\\'s voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won\\'t get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won\\'t recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Detailed review --Design - 4/5+Reduced notch+Premium glass back-Camera bumpPerformance - 5/5+Latest and greatest hardware+Smart optimisationsOS - 4.5/5+Smooth Android experience - Oxygen OSDisplay - 4.5/5+Butter smooth 90 Hz Amoled display - treat to the eyeBattery -3.5/5+Fastest charging ever seen-Less capacityCamera -4/5+Overall good output with all 3 cameras+ Amazing macro mode- Misses details and messes up with Colors sometimesAudio - 4/5+Clear and loud - quality output\\n\\n \\n\\n  Awesome experience..best in class camera... oxygen os..love\\n\\n \\n\\n  I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can\\'t come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn\\'t even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  My first one+7t & its make me so sad. I received the ph with manufacturing defect in display. Gum came out from the edges of display. How can a consumer aspects from a reputed brand after he paying 40000/- 🤔😭😟🥺😓\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?\\n\\n \\n\\n  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON\\'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.\\n\\n \\n\\n  No earphone jack\\n\\n \\n\\n  A One plus user.Oneplus One -> Oneplus 3T -> Oneplus 7T.I don\\'t like other android phones due it\\'s UI, love stock android.Camara is awesomeFacing problem with notifications, don\\'t know what at top.I was expecting great battery but its average.As i moved from 3T to 7T, I had to buy wireless headphones and was worried about this. But Bluetooth connection is also good/stable.\\n\\n \\n\\n  The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn\\'t require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes. It gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue. The battery back up is just pathetic. Not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price OnePlus is selling this device. If option available, I would have asked for refund.\\n\\n \\n\\n  After 1st update battery capacity is good\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0I am uploading a video and image watch it before but it,Don\\'t waste your money on this phone @this price range.Many customers faces same as I am facing the issue of screen flickering while watching videos specially YouTube.. if u do not noticed, now notice it on the upper side where the notch is setup. Play YouTube u can see when u do for full screen and again normal.I am purchased it but thanks to Amazon they replaced it but again same issue \\'screen flickering\\' and again thanks to Amazon they approve my return and now I get my refund..But seriously this device is not too good at this price. So pls don\\'t waste your money.And OnePlus, with u never expect like this.\\n\\n \\n\\n  It has many features to tell but will tell only two problems of it..1. Battery Draining like hell.2. Heating issues.Don\\'t know why but these two severe problems I\\'m facing..I play games..Never ever expected such experience with this Premium Phone..\\n\\n \\n\\n  Very worst on speed. hanging and not responding at all. Got mobile day before yesterday on 2nd Oct and installed only basic apps like whatsapp, fb, banking apps and no movies or any other images or music loaded but still it is hanging.Now the clock is not working and the alarm is not ringing which is a very basic feature\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality l, gestures, condition of package all very good.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This beast puts One Plus back in the game!7T should have been the only product launched by OnePlus instead of 7 & 7pro!What a phone it is!Processing speed 5/5Camera 4.2/5Look n Feel 4.8/5Performance 5/5Lags 0/5Charging 5/5Highlights:90GHz screen refresh rate is something that\\'s puts OnePlus 7T in the league of the iPhones and the S10.Cons:Nightmode could have been better!Not upto the mark of Pixel and even iPhone 11Battery could have been 4000mah, but still 30T warp is a mind-blowing deal.Memory slot could have been arranged.Wow factor:30T 😘Telephoto lens 😘Configs 8GB-128 combo is sufficientNow, coming to comparison with iPhone XR and iPhone 11, personally I would prefer OnePlus because of flexibility, Android ecosystem provides to the users.Verdict:A perfect benchmark from most of the parameters.Performance wise is a SHOWSTOPPER!!Should you upgrade from 7 to 7T -NO, save your money.From iPhone 8 or Below to 7T -Yes\\n\\n \\n\\n  Amazing phone.. and charging is awesome.. 0 to 100 in just 51 min\\n\\n \\n\\n  Firstly, I didn\\'t receive my headset. It\\'s mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I\\'m facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It\\'s on and off but it still bothers me. Didn\\'t expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don\\'t like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I was using Samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try.  Received oneplus7t and set up the phone.  Not worth of spending. They don\\'t have 3.5 mm audio jack and they don\\'t provide type c connector also. Samsung phone comes with good quality headphones.  When apple released phone without audio Jack, they provided connector.It\\'s big disappointment for me as I make lot of calls using earphones.One plus need to think about it..\\n\\n \\n\\n  It is good phone. Best at it\\'s price point. Great phone better than Asus Rog phone 2 in overall performance. Buy it without any second thought. Better display 90hz fluid amoled 2400*1080. If you want a allrounder go for it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Do not buy this device almost 40% of buyers have recieved phones with faulty display and amazon is not allowing replacement\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone is just lit 🔥...one of the best phone I hv ever seen .... everything about is just flawless ...worth buying ... I\\'m loving it ❤️\\n\\n \\n\\n  Camera quality is worst while opening portrait mode back camera stop working , while putting status on WhatsApp it select by own not that picture which you select.....I am continuously in contact with Amazon customer care they just said do this do that....it\\'s being 4 days of purchase....what they think we don\\'t know how to operate......if there is some fault replace it....why you people are just wasting our time.....first we spend a good amount of money and now we just waste our time....it\\'s a request kindly replace it before your replacement time period over...as it\\'s 15 Oct and 9th Oct already completed in nonsense thingsThanks and regardsAmazon customer\\n\\n \\n\\n  Beast compared to any product and wonderful product provided by one plus.Thanks for the one plus tean.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Want to return but they are denying. Battery draining very fast and there are some gap on the back panel. Not happy with the Amazon services no one helping\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst services from Amazon, and 2nd class product from oneplus..design of the phone has no premium quality. Phones under 20k have better built quality than oneplus.. my first and last experience with oneplus. And Amazon train your people with adequate knowledge...\\n\\n \\n\\n  Good quality camera, great finger print reader , enormous battery life with fast charging , easy to handle, beautiful user interface, timely delivered , thanks Amazon. 😃🥰👍\\n\\n \\n\\n  I\\'m an iPhone user for last few years!! So I had a feeling any Android device cannot beat the camera, display and user interface experience of iphone. But here it is, OnePlus 7T with 90hz display is just a magic in hand. And also the camera is just superb.Initially I wanted to go for iPhone 11, buy instead decided to go for this and I feel I made a right decision. So close to eyes and go for this, you\\'ll love it\\n\\n \\n\\n  I don\\'t wanna rate this item.. A cheap class defected product I have received from amazon and plz guys don\\'t order any electronic item like mobile phone laptop anything. 90% of us get defected item from amazon. and now these guys are not taking it back.. I complained them so many times but no one wants to listen..  I complained first day itself when I got delivered this prodect and they have fixed my appointment with some of their technician but no one came to check this product. It\\'s been 6 days now but no action from there side so please I requested to all of you who looks for electric product on amazon. plz don\\'t buy 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎\\n\\n \\n\\n  Display 5*Camera 5Performance 5Battery 4\\n\\n \\n\\n  Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it\\'s money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro, Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money.Interface- I used MIUI, EMIUI, amigo os, but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It\\'s super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram).Camera- One of the best under 50k that\\'s the only thing I can say.Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphonesDisplay- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes, really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone)Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.\\n\\n \\n\\n  This phone has overheating issue even for normal browsing. A reputed brand with an issues like this is not acceptable. I am not happy with my phone after investing so much. Amazon has to be taken care there trusted buyers by replacing the defected phone.\\n\\n \\n\\n  I think heating issue this phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone looks great and works well. Except it\\'s got a glitch strip occassionally on the top while I use YouTube. I\\'ve been trying to contact the Amazon team for a while now but to no avail\\n\\n \\n\\n  Did not get three cases with 7t mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Worst camera ever... Cheap quality of back cover... Straight away denied when i ask for exchange on the same time within 2 hrs.Please do not buy oneplus 7t is you needed camera. Instead buy iphone or vivo...Wasted my money.Also amazon is responsible for not taking back phone on the very same day.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Got my phone yesterday, it\\'s just amazing 😍Pros: Camera is amazing, it is super fast and look is splendid.Cons: heats up a bit while charging and drains quite fast.Great phone overall.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Update 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn\\'t make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven\\'t used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\\n \\n\\n  this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen.there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS.but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Pros:Design looks sleek and easy to handle though it\\'s a big screen. Well balanced in the hand. My 3T feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference.Good Speed and performance.Very good display.Excellent cameras. Definitely a big change from previous models.Cons:Still in the process of experiencing the product. Will update based on my findings.\\n\\n \\n\\n  No more function.When call from second sim first sim net disconnectedNot daily data usage option.Cheap phone. I really hurt after buy this company phone\\n\\n \\n\\n  Phone is good but cover of the is given by OnePlus is damage. Let me know the procedure to replace .\\n\\n \\n\\n  Nice phone...Camera superb, Battery great and ideal premium phone at such an affordable price\\n\\n \\n\\n  Hands down. It\\'s a beast. Flagship killer anyday.Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price.Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger.Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premiumStock android experience which I always love.Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now, iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent.I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn\\'t look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don\\'t need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing.Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go.Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.Hope this review is useful.\\n\\n \\n\\n  From \"Darshita Electronics\", Today I received my New OP7T 8GB/128GB Glacier Blue model. But the device is Not Booting even after 1Hour and also doesn\\'t restart as well. Customer support person told me to Charge for 4 hours..! The device is already in Hot condition. I don\\'t know how it resolves the issue. Feeling cheated after spending a hard-earned money. Waiting for the replacement. Instead of buying from third party vendors, better Buy from OnePlus Site itself.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Battery life sucks!It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage.Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery.Think before you purchase.I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery. Otherwise everything else is fine with this phone. OnePlus needs to optimise the phone!\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\xa0This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can\\'t help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it\\'s just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it\\'s not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I\\'m just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don\\'t buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.\\n\\n \\n\\n  Product is worse, with respect to camera, it cannot reproduce the skin tone or texture even under broad day light. It struggles to sharpness and structure of image.My earlier review was removed for being honest, let\\'s see, the Amazon is really considering to hide the fact by not accepting the real customer problem and removing it\\n\\n \\n\\n  The said phone is a piece of beauty. Looks amazingly beautiful in hand and the in-hand feeling is just awesome.From the very beginning the buying process on Amazon is simply smooth thereafter the product was delivered before the expected delivery time.The phone looks really sophisticated and the 90 Hz Display is smooth like never before. The Glacier Blue colour is the one which is being promoted predominantly by OnePlus but trust me the Frosted Silver colour is stunning.These are just the initial impressions and a more detailed review will follow after a few days of intense usage.\\n\\n'"

       "' after reading a lot of geeky reviews on youtube and portals i bought oneplus t pls note i have been using oneplus from last many years now so my expectations were clear my experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced pls note i have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free so pls don t go by them blindly go for users reviews who bought them with their own money so i am writing my days experience with the phone i am not a gamer or a geek a regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone social media blogging and vlogging etc the last oneplus phone i was using was oneplus and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself the day it arrived from amazon i opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till i have held it in my hands here are the issues weight it weighed too much i felt like holding a brick and it is thick when i hold it in one hand for a few minutes i get a deep red pit in my hand due to blood circulation camera then i had to go for a conference there i tried clicking pictures picture quality did not come out well still i thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences i could not believe it to be not good so i continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing as you zoom in it will make it blurred i have clicked a magazine cover picture with my oneplus which had only mp camera but pic quality was natural and good it clicks blur pics may it has to do with image stabilization battery battery is avg all those time i teased my iphone or samsung series colleagues and friends for their battery life welcome to the league this offers an avg battery life i never carried a charger with me in previous models if i start with even after two years but here i have to carry it even for the average usage i m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device it will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to hz which is an option given in the display settings if you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to hz not for people who are on the move most of the time don t fall for it sound it s average phone calls are not crisp and clear at times the caller s voice gets hazy and husky voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me even on lower volumes speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good no premium feeling anymore with multiple variants it has joined the league of samsung mi oppo vivo now they are launching t pro on oct again it is a disappointment for those who bought t on day maybe their r d or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults like oneplus has voice receiver on one side which is right so if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won t get a clear voice or volume so they added receivers on both the side in this device i am still not getting why i have spent rs on it no camera quality no battery life no sound quality on calls getting wounds on holding it for long i have always recommended oneplus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that i bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience i won t recommend oneplus t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices detailed review design reduced notch premium glass back camera bumpperformance latest and greatest hardware smart optimisationsos smooth android experience oxygen osdisplay butter smooth hz amoled display treat to the eyebattery fastest charging ever seen less capacitycamera overall good output with all cameras amazing macro mode misses details and messes up with colors sometimesaudio clear and loud quality output awesome experience best in class camera oxygen os love i received one plus t days back i will describe you my experience in these days firstly kudos to amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging coming to the mobile the first impression is just amazing its smooth fast and you can t come out of it the amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing battery backup is also too good and it took me min to charge from to pros camera battery display performance speed gaming experience consno headset jack one plus didn t even provide mm type c converter either which dissapointed me camera design could have been made better but i feel better compared to apple pro overall one plus proves again why its the best mobile right now go for it my first one t its make me so sad i received the ph with manufacturing defect in display gum came out from the edges of display how can a consumer aspects from a reputed brand after he paying this phone has great performance good camera and ambiance charging is fast as per the oneplus standards set in earlier phones what is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on the battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at hz to longer life is there anyone else feeling the heating issues this is one of the worst phone i have ever purchased please dont buy this phone and put your hard earned money on stake there are so many cons in this phone earlier i have used one plus t phone so i knew what to expect from this phone but this time i am so much disappointed here are my concerns screen resolution and quality of the screen is so poor there is grains and color banding issue in screen images looks grainy and unsharp in comparision to one plus t or t phone ratio is so instagram images will be in shown in portrait mode instead of landscape mode images on the screen is so blurrry design of the phone is mess so much camera bulk even the provided case cannot protect it from scratches phone is very fat and haevy length is also too much because of the ratio also there is no premium feeling after holding this phone as was with the one plus t mm jack is big ommission since one plus phone there is no benefit of removing it there is no bigger battery also you have to buy a seperate adapter or new blutooth earphones and blutooth earphones quality can never be as good as wired earphones camera quality is average no increase in picture quality cameras are only for name sake i was very happy one plus customer but now i won t recommend this phone to anyone please dont waste your money no earphone jack a one plus user oneplus one oneplus t oneplus t i don t like other android phones due it s ui love stock android camara is awesomefacing problem with notifications don t know what at top i was expecting great battery but its average as i moved from t to t i had to buy wireless headphones and was worried about this but bluetooth connection is also good stable the smart lock feature is not working on the phone it doesn t require pin fingerprint sensor sometimes it gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue the battery back up is just pathetic not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price oneplus is selling this device if option available i would have asked for refund after st update battery capacity is good i am uploading a video and image watch it before but it don t waste your money on this phone this price range many customers faces same as i am facing the issue of screen flickering while watching videos specially youtube if u do not noticed now notice it on the upper side where the notch is setup play youtube u can see when u do for full screen and again normal i am purchased it but thanks to amazon they replaced it but again same issue screen flickering and again thanks to amazon they approve my return and now i get my refund but seriously this device is not too good at this price so pls don t waste your money and oneplus with u never expect like this it has many features to tell but will tell only two problems of it battery draining like hell heating issues don t know why but these two severe problems i m facing i play games never ever expected such experience with this premium phone very worst on speed hanging and not responding at all got mobile day before yesterday on nd oct and installed only basic apps like whatsapp fb banking apps and no movies or any other images or music loaded but still it is hanging now the clock is not working and the alarm is not ringing which is a very basic feature camera quality l gestures condition of package all very good this beast puts one plus back in the game t should have been the only product launched by oneplus instead of pro what a phone it is processing speed camera look n feel performance lags charging highlights ghz screen refresh rate is something that s puts oneplus t in the league of the iphones and the s cons nightmode could have been better not upto the mark of pixel and even iphone battery could have been mah but still t warp is a mind blowing deal memory slot could have been arranged wow factor t telephoto lens configs gb combo is sufficientnow coming to comparison with iphone xr and iphone personally i would prefer oneplus because of flexibility android ecosystem provides to the users verdict a perfect benchmark from most of the parameters performance wise is a showstopper should you upgrade from to t no save your money from iphone or below to t yes amazing phone and charging is awesome to in just min firstly i didn t receive my headset it s mentioned on amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box this is like misleading the customers by giving false information secondly i want to say i like everything about this phone this is my first oneplus phone and i love oxygen os having said that i m facing some minor heating issues with my phone it s on and off but it still bothers me didn t expect it would happen with oneplus hope this can be fixed had heard a lot about oneplus so when i decided to purchase a new phone i picked oneplus t over rog battery is decent does not drain out quickly using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage i don t like the camera of this phone when you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird samsung oppo vivo are far better when it comes to camera wide angle photos also come out odd when you click objects using wide angle they come out well but when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad especially with the selfie camera this phone has the worse selfie camera i was earlier using samsung s edge which was much smaller compared to oneplus t this phone is big so it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone i was using samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try received oneplus t and set up the phone not worth of spending they don t have mm audio jack and they don t provide type c connector also samsung phone comes with good quality headphones when apple released phone without audio jack they provided connector it s big disappointment for me as i make lot of calls using earphones one plus need to think about it it is good phone best at it s price point great phone better than asus rog phone in overall performance buy it without any second thought better display hz fluid amoled if you want a allrounder go for it do not buy this device almost of buyers have recieved phones with faulty display and amazon is not allowing replacement this phone is just lit one of the best phone i hv ever seen everything about is just flawless worth buying i m loving it camera quality is worst while opening portrait mode back camera stop working while putting status on whatsapp it select by own not that picture which you select i am continuously in contact with amazon customer care they just said do this do that it s being days of purchase what they think we don t know how to operate if there is some fault replace it why you people are just wasting our time first we spend a good amount of money and now we just waste our time it s a request kindly replace it before your replacement time period over as it s oct and th oct already completed in nonsense thingsthanks and regardsamazon customer beast compared to any product and wonderful product provided by one plus thanks for the one plus tean i had been using mi for the past years loved the software experience there but i knew something was lacking on the hardware end i decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the k mark like s e or pixel a and i had almost bought either one just when the pics of the oneplus t were teased online by oneplus the design of the op t had my attention immediately and i decided to wait for it not much review and comparison videos for the t were available before the first sale but blown away by the sheer looks of t i instantly bought the oneplus t as soon as it went on sale on th and trust me i will never regret my decision to choose oneplus i will now classify this review category wise design the design looks fabulous elegant is the right word for the frosted silver colour the matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous mirror finishes in hand the phone is taller than oneplus t for comparison but is a tad thinner and feels lighter the overall in hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case it doesn t slip it feels premium for sure camera the triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous oneplus as well as mi phones the photo quality is great sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera the nightscape images are good too the macro mode is something i ve never seen on any phone before the macros are so up close and detailed check my nightscape and macro mode samples the main camera has ois and eis and the videos are really stable that s what i was talking about the ois as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones and i am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera as i m not a fan of pop up cams and i just doubt their longevity in real world conditions battery first of all the warp charge is some serious tech i mean from to it just charged in less than an hour also oneplus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won t be any heating issues as for the battery back up on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly even on standby but in the next couple of days the android ai kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when i was not using the phone i also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half s backup moreover the full dark mode in the developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it s an amoled screen sot my screen on time immediately before this review was around hours with battery still left and time since last charge was hours no gaming in these hours but i watched netflix youtube used whatsapp twitter instagram browsed the web made calls and my g data was active the entire time update after receiving a small mb update for bug fixes and camera improvement my sot was a little over hours minutes over a day and a half s usage which is insane considering the hz display well sot and battery backup total depends on usage pattern mine includes calling texting browsing social media over g mobile data but no gaming so far screen t has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours you can calibrate the display as per your taste the much hyped hz display is true you can really feel the difference between a hz and a hz hz is so much smoother software t came with android out of the box what more can you ask for also the oxygen os is great stock android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware it s an amazing experience overall performance well here the numbers say it all check the antutu scores it just tops the list blazing fast speed and performance instantly opens and switches apps without any lag didn t face any hang or freeze issues so far no device heating issues so far haptic feedback guys you really need to feel it to believe it the haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level customer support i didn t encounter any issues to be calling customer care but i called them to inquire about how to avail the free year extended warranty yes you read it right oneplus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it well as for the customer care i was very well guided as to how to avail it also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up protection plans i would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on oneplus website they are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage i bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price i paid for this device is insured all in all i would say it s a true flagship device in the s price bracket i just don t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more perhaps wireless charging and ip rating but those features aren t a deal breaker as the warp charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can t use the phone while wirelessly charging it i don t find any practicality in wireless charging as for the ip rating i would say it s unofficially fairly water resistant checkout various water drop tests on you tube but just don t try them pwell just go for this phone if your budget allows for a true flagship experience you won t regret buying it want to return but they are denying battery draining very fast and there are some gap on the back panel not happy with the amazon services no one helping worst services from amazon and nd class product from oneplus design of the phone has no premium quality phones under k have better built quality than oneplus my first and last experience with oneplus and amazon train your people with adequate knowledge good quality camera great finger print reader enormous battery life with fast charging easy to handle beautiful user interface timely delivered thanks amazon i m an iphone user for last few years so i had a feeling any android device cannot beat the camera display and user interface experience of iphone but here it is oneplus t with hz display is just a magic in hand and also the camera is just superb initially i wanted to go for iphone buy instead decided to go for this and i feel i made a right decision so close to eyes and go for this you ll love it i don t wanna rate this item a cheap class defected product i have received from amazon and plz guys don t order any electronic item like mobile phone laptop anything of us get defected item from amazon and now these guys are not taking it back i complained them so many times but no one wants to listen i complained first day itself when i got delivered this prodect and they have fixed my appointment with some of their technician but no one came to check this product it s been days now but no action from there side so please i requested to all of you who looks for electric product on amazon plz don t buy display camera performance battery was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives oneplus pro a run for it s money but having using since last days i am assured that it does give oneplus pro samsung s and even iphone a run for the money interface i used miui emiui amigo os but none of those were never smooth as oxygen os it s super fluid and killing fast credit also goes to sd and gb ram camera one of the best under k that s the only thing i can say built quality on par with other premium smartphonesdisplay have used lcd panel display phones for entire life so yes really enjoying watching videos and to make the things more sweeter stereo speakers on the phone verdict if you can spend k more than oneplus then do it it will be worth it this phone has overheating issue even for normal browsing a reputed brand with an issues like this is not acceptable i am not happy with my phone after investing so much amazon has to be taken care there trusted buyers by replacing the defected phone i think heating issue this phone phone looks great and works well except it s got a glitch strip occassionally on the top while i use youtube i ve been trying to contact the amazon team for a while now but to no avail did not get three cases with t mobile worst camera ever cheap quality of back cover straight away denied when i ask for exchange on the same time within hrs please do not buy oneplus t is you needed camera instead buy iphone or vivo wasted my money also amazon is responsible for not taking back phone on the very same day got my phone yesterday it s just amazing pros camera is amazing it is super fast and look is splendid cons heats up a bit while charging and drains quite fast great phone overall update currently on and after almost a year the device is still going strong no signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration last geekbench score was same as the day i got it which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than fingers enrolled update just got the new update to oxygen os and the issues with the gaming mode are gone been using this for days now and let me say this first this is a great device and i am really really glad i bought this and not samsung note now here is my review broken down in pros and cons list pros comes with pre applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box as always cable quality is great and charger is well built display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a hdr certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience in hand feel is also great the device has a weight to it that doesn t make it too heavy or to light to use the back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous oneplus devices i have big hands so i can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation performance is just top notch i haven t used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device everything feels so natural and seamless the hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device speakers are not as good as the asus rog phone or the iphone xs pro max but they are great for the price range and may be equal to samsung note series call quality is great on jio and vodafone networks mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes charging speeds are great too got the device fully charged from tot in just and hour and that is great the new android with oxygen os is great and fluid as i said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the oneplus team the front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet the same goes for the triple camera setup at the back it is a good camera but can be made better using the software in a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out in low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the macro shots battery life is great and i am constantly getting around hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device cons hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement there is a bug whenever i open a game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then o have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen the camera software is not optimized yet battery life can be an issue for some users the navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the android screen they are slow clumsy and needs a lot of getting use to by someone who is coming from the older oneplus gestures not to mention the issues i feel while using the back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case i have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every time and now i have switched back to older button navigation this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen there is a red green tint issue at lower brightness levels i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and os but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue please beware before buying this check this thing the moment your device arrives get brightness below and see if there is tint on dark grey black backgrounds if there is promptly return it because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards pros design looks sleek and easy to handle though it s a big screen well balanced in the hand my t feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference good speed and performance very good display excellent cameras definitely a big change from previous models cons still in the process of experiencing the product will update based on my findings no more function when call from second sim first sim net disconnectednot daily data usage option cheap phone i really hurt after buy this company phone phone is good but cover of the is given by oneplus is damage let me know the procedure to replace nice phone camera superb battery great and ideal premium phone at such an affordable price hands down it s a beast flagship killer anyday lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price battery performance is not that great but for the hz display i think it does just fine and anyway your getting the w fast charger customisations in oxygen os are cool and hardware feels premiumstock android experience which i always love scary part is the glass back feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact for now iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent i see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn t look that ugly at all camera does the job perfectly in all modes you don t need the iphone pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing overall i would give this phone a and a major go buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent oneplus phones can be easily used for years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly hope this review is useful from darshita electronics today i received my new op t gb gb glacier blue model but the device is not booting even after hour and also doesn t restart as well customer support person told me to charge for hours the device is already in hot condition i don t know how it resolves the issue feeling cheated after spending a hard earned money waiting for the replacement instead of buying from third party vendors better buy from oneplus site itself battery life sucks it drains completely in less than hours after countinous usage iphone gives about hours of sot even after having a small battery think before you purchase i want oneplus and amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery otherwise everything else is fine with this phone oneplus needs to optimise the phone this is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought oneplus t first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining although the oneplus t has battery draining issue but the one i had was so rapid in battery draining so within the return period i requested for a refund but amazon denied and only issued for a replacement i tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request so i got my replacement when coming to this replaced device this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera front cam is not working at all and oneplus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use i fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams so they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact oneplus i contacted oneplus they also repeated the same they can t help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone is it fair enough from amazon or oneplus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue so without any option i went to kochi service centre for repairing they checked my phone and they told that it s just a software issue and told me to come after some hours so i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back then i checked infront of them very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it s not functioning so without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back so probably what would we do this is my experience from amazon and oneplus side so you decide before buying this phone worst phone and worst service from amazon and oneplus side i m just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks please don t buy it from amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand product is worse with respect to camera it cannot reproduce the skin tone or texture even under broad day light it struggles to sharpness and structure of image my earlier review was removed for being honest let s see the amazon is really considering to hide the fact by not accepting the real customer problem and removing it the said phone is a piece of beauty looks amazingly beautiful in hand and the in hand feeling is just awesome from the very beginning the buying process on amazon is simply smooth thereafter the product was delivered before the expected delivery time the phone looks really sophisticated and the hz display is smooth like never before the glacier blue colour is the one which is being promoted predominantly by oneplus but trust me the frosted silver colour is stunning these are just the initial impressions and a more detailed review will follow after a few days of intense usage '"
